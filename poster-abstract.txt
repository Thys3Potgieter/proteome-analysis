Increased concentration of proteins with growth rate can result from passive resource redistribution


In many microorganisms, the proteome composition changes dramatically as a function of the growth environment.
Furthermore, many of these changes seem to be coordinated with the growth rate.
However, although cellular growth rates, gene expression levels and gene regulation have been at the center of biological research for decades, their quantitative interdependence is not yet fully understood.

We analyzed global trends in two proteome composition data sets for the model microorganism E.coli under various growth conditions, and specifically, their relation to growth rate.
We found that the cellular concentration of a large fraction of the proteins measured coordinately increases with the growth rate.
This fraction includes proteins spanning different functional groups and proteins that are involved in different cellular processes.
Notably, Ribosomal proteins are only a small fraction of this group of proteins.

We present a simple model that explains how such a widely coordinated increase in the concentration of many proteins can be the result of passive redistribution of resources, due to active regulation of a few unrelated proteins.
Our model further explains why and how such changes relate to the growth rate under different environmental conditions.
The model thus suggests that, although the concentrations of many proteins change with the growth rate, such changes could be part of a global effect, not requiring specific cellular control mechanisms.
