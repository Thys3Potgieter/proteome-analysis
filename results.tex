\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{
A significant fraction of the proteins have positive correlation with the growth rate.
These proteins span all the functional groups.
Proteins with unknown function show less correlation with growth rate (as well as proteins with low levels of expression, data not shown).
}
\label{growth-corr}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{GlobalClusterCorr.pdf}
\caption{
Proteins that have a high corrleation (0.4-0.8) with growth rate mostly have even higher correlation to the sum of these proteins (both weighted sum and normalized sum are presented).
Weighted sum means the concentrations of all proteins in the group are summed.
Normalized sum means every protein is first normalized to have an average concentration of 1 across the different growth conditions, and then all proteins in the group are summed.
The higher correlation indicates that their response is coordinated (they scale by the same factor between conditions).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{GlobalClusterRSquare.pdf}
\caption{
Plotting the $r^2$ distribution shows that a large fraction of the variability of these proteins is captured by the global response.
}
\label{global-rsq}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{GlobalClusterGRFit.pdf}
\caption{
The global cluster is reasonably correlated with growth rate.
Some of the unexplained variability of the global cluster by the growth rate can indicate errors in growth rate measurements and/or differences in degredation rates across conditions.
}

\begin{itemize}
 
\item These proteins have the same response.
figure - distribution of slopes/intercepts, correlation/$r^2$ with global sum vs. individually with the growth rate, covariance between the clusters, pca. if possible - confidence intervals.
\item This happens in multiple organisms and datasets (show yeast, two datasets of coli). Possibly add mRNA measurements.
\end{itemize}
