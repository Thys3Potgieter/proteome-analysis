\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
A significant fraction of the proteins have positive correlation with the growth rate.
figure - covariance distribution.
\item A large fraction of the variability of these proteins between conditions can be explained by the growth rate.
figure - r^2 of positively correlated proteins.
\item These proteins have the same response.
figure - distribution of slopes/intercepts, correlation/r^2 with global sum vs. individually with the growth rate, covariance between the clusters, pca. if possible - confidence intervals.
\item These are not only ribosomal proteins (show counts by gene functions, includeing/excluding unmapped proteins).
\item This happens in multiple organisms and datasets (show yeast, two datasets of coli). Possibly add mRNA measurements.
\end{itemize}
